# myAEPP
An Android study companion for Greek High School students (Grade 12) focusing on Computer Science (ΑΕΠΠ). Built with Kotlin and embedded WebViews.

## Motivation

The inspiration for this project came from a personal cause. I have been providing voluntary tutoring to a student preparing for her second attempt at the Panhellenic Exams (Computer Science subject - ΑΕΠΠ).

Observing the challenges she faced with complex concepts and the need for constant practice, I decided to build this app to:
<ul>
<li>Provide a mobile-friendly way to study theory on the go.</li>

<li>Offer interactive tools to simplify algorithmic logic.</li>

<li>Support her journey (and others') toward success with a personalized learning tool.</li>

</ul>
