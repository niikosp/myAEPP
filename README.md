# myΑΕΠΠ
An Android study companion for Greek High School students (Grade 12) focusing on Computer Science (ΑΕΠΠ). Built on Android Studio, with Kotlin and embedded WebViews.

## Motivation

The inspiration for this project came from a personal cause. I have been providing voluntary tutoring to a student preparing for her second attempt at the Panhellenic Exams (Computer Science subject - ΑΕΠΠ).

Observing the challenges she faced with complex concepts and the need for constant practice, I decided to build this app to:
<ul>
<li>Provide a mobile-friendly way to study theory on the go.</li>

<li>Offer interactive tools to simplify algorithmic logic.</li>

<li>Support her journey (and others') toward success with a personalized learning tool.</li>

</ul>

## Development process

This project was developed using a modern AI-assisted workflow.

<ol>
<li>Logic & Backend: Leveraged AI tools (like Gemini/ChatGPT) to generate and optimize Kotlin components, focusing on rapid prototyping and clean code structures.</li>

<li>Frontend & UI: Personally designed and implemented the UI using HTML, CSS to ensure a custom user experience tailored to the student's needs.</li>

<li>Curation: All educational content and curriculum logic were manually structured to align with the official Greek Ministry of Education (ΑΕΠΠ) standards.</li>
